# morse_code_project
Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicksthat can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observ. Additionally, I implemented sound output sothat the Morse code can be heard audibly. This can enhance the user experience and make it easier to interpret Morse code, I also implemented error handling to ensure the program gracefully handles unexpected inputs or errors during encoding and decodinge without special equipment.This translator provides functionality to convert both text messages to Morse code and Morse code back to text
